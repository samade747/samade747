👋 Hi, I’m @samade747

👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, specifically with the MERN stack. I also have a growing interest in TypeScript and its applications in modern web development.

🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript to enhance my development skills and improve my code quality. I'm also working on an Attendance Management System using the MERN stack.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript. I am also open to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with like-minded developers.
